A repository of code to run field theoretic simulation of polymeric liquids.
Currently, the codebase is divided into various system-specific simulation files. A future update will integrate all code into a single program that runs general FTS simulations for any molecular system. 
All simulations are GPU-accelerated with `cupy`.
