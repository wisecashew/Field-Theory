I am going to be exploring a fairly large search space. I need to nail down some particulars to make sure I don't get lost in the sauce. 
Fix certain things: pressure <-> density. Aim for a pressure greater than 1. Aim for about 5.

All bonds are set to an equilibrium distance of 0. <=== Something to question. How do I get an average bond length? 
All spring constants are set to K_i = 1, where `i` is the species. Does this mean anything? Check the RDFs. 
All interactions are modeled using Ï‡ parameters. Am I fucking up somehow? Check the math. 
Calculate Rg distributions for these systems.
Think through this slowly...
